# Pre-Round 1 practice - Ubuntu 16.04

## Morty, a 14 year old student in the dimesion C137 needs your help

His grandfather, Rick, is stuck in another dimension and needs to remotely connect to Morty's computer over `SSH` to access some files.

However, Morty does not know how to do this, and has asked you to help him out. Rick knows Morty keeps some Very Hideous Secrets on this computer, and thus should only allow Rick to `SSH` and remotely access Morty's computer.

In addition, Morty has some other unwanted programs. Please remove these.

Morty no longer uses this computer for media, and should not contain any movies or videos.

Rick needs to be able to connect with stability over many dimensions, and thus this computer should remain on the latest version of Ubuntu 16.04. All updates should be installed to prevent interdimensional viruses.

Be sure to use your best security practices to keep Rick safe from interdimensional viruses and Morty from his Very Hideous Secrets

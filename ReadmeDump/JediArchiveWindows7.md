# Welcome to the Jedi Archives!

#### As the new Jedi Keeper of the Temple Archives, you are tasked with securing this Jedi Archive workstation running Windows 7.

Please ensure that the latest version of `Firefox` is installed and set as the default browser.
However, some of the older Masters prefer `Internet Explorer` so the latest version of `Internet Explorer` must be installed as well.

The Jedi Council has decreed that all users should be using a secure password.
However, this policy may not be currently enforced on this workstation.

This is a strictly work-only computer and so there should not be any games or other media on it.

The user `pamidala` has recently complained that they are unable to log in to the workstation.
Ensure their account is operational again.

All installed programs should be updated to their latest versions or removed, depending if they are legitimate programs or not.

Since the Jedi are spread throughout the Galaxy due to the Clone Wars and cannot access the Temple, this workstation also is a server using `XAMPP` to manage it.
The version of `XAMPP` is 5.6.3.0 and since the Jedi have found that this is the most stable version of `XAMPP` they have ordered you not to update it to a later version.
This is a `MySQL` and `FTP` server.
The Jedi Council has ordered that `MySQL` and `FTP` from `XAMPP` be installed as a service for extra stability and security.

Good luck, and may the Force be with you.

# Linux Engine - Demo

You have been appointed as head of the cyber security department in a new startup, Virtual Holographic Sandwiches, allowing people to experience the sandwich before buying them. However, the primary administrative workstation has numerous security flaws and holes, due to the startup not having a cyber security expert beforehand. To prepare for your position, the previous user's account has been removed and your account, `user` has been created. 

This computer will NOT be used for development of the Virtual Hologram, so no development tools should be installed. This workstation is strictly management only, and should have the latest versions of `samba`, `ftp`, `mysql`, `ssh`, and `wordpress` installed. There should be no media files or hacking tools on this computer, as both are violations of company policy. 

Do not change your account name! The services listed are critical for this company. Do not remove them!

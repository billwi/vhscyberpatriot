# Welcome to the Jedi Archives!

As the new Jedi Keeper of the Archives, you are tasked with securing this Jedi Archive workstation running `Ubuntu 16.04 "Xeniel Xerus"`: DO NOT UPGRADE!  

Please ensure that the latest version of `Firefox` is installed and set as the default browser.

The Jedi Council has decreed that all users should be using a secure password. Chances are, the older Masters who had previously secured this computer did not know how. Make sure this is enforced.

This is a strictly work-only computer and no games (other than solitare and other pre-installed games), documentaries, etc. should be on here.

Oftentimes, the masters enjoy remote access. Make sure `ssh` is properly configured and secured.

The user `pamidala` has just gotten back from a week-long break and no longer remembers the password. Set it to `CyberPatriot1!`

All production software should be updated to the latest version.

All system software should also be updated.

All bloat/shady software should be removed. Note that netcat should remain installed

Good luck, and may the Force be with you.

#### Note:
> There is no scoring report for a reason! Run `gen-report` on the desktop, and email Vinay the scoreReport.tar.gz file so he can hand-grade it and give you the results

> DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING ON THE DESKTOP. DO NOT REMOVE ANY FILE WITH NAMES containing `scorer`, `cyberpatriot`, `scorereport` or the like.
